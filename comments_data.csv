4,"Hai Sir, Thank you for this video. I dont know even a single alphabet in this subject when compared to  all other viewers. But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information. Now If I tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how I could knew about this subject. Thanking your Sir once again.

But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information. Now If I tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how I could knew about this subject. Thanking your Sir once again.

915,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",Luke Barousse,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

It's definitely for entry-level people and I would better polish my python skills instead of learning R. Spreadsheets used in this course is Google Sheets, data base - BigQuery, all Google products.

I loved the Google over the A+ stuff as there is so much more hands-on and more engaging material. I believe the Google IT would carry a lot more weight if the course had a proctored final exam. To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week. As for as time, they suggest 6 months, I did it in 10 weeks as I was taking my A+ material.

928,Just some of my feedback as I am on Module 5 for the Data Analytics professional certificate. I currently just graduated with my BA in marketing and minored in applied computing. I believe what these courses is very similar conceptually. Starting Module 5 I am starting to work more on the technical assignments diving into SQL.

On another note, I feel like companies saying that they accept certificates in place of a college degree is a bit disingenuous. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel like unless you're a prodigy with some amazing side projects, companies won't bat an eye if you don't have some college degree. I highly doubt major corporations will take person A who has a Google Analytics certificate over person B who has a CS degree from a university - assuming all other variables are the same.

I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",Ken Jee,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

1407,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player.

1483,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information.

1815,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",Alex The Analyst,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel like unless you're a prodigy with some amazing side projects, companies won't bat an eye if you don't have some college degree.

1907,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player.

1983,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

I have to say I become obsessed with programming, the challenges were so much fun, I enjoyed a lot. However, I always thougth it was impossible to make a carreer in programming, data analyst because I assumed computer science people would always be chosen/employed over me, I mean, they have a whole university training in that! So I never persue that path... Difficult now to see it was possible... I wish there is still a way. Haven't done much in programming since 5 years... but still love it, that's why I ended up watching you here, last week have been looking for small programming task to warm up my brain again",Alex The Analyst,0.009294871794871788,0.6041666666666666,Neutral

But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information.

Power BI is not mentioned and Python is not covered which are extremely popular tools.",Corey Schafer,0.375,0.5750000000000001,Positive
2415,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",Corey Schafer,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week.

On another note, I feel like companies saying that they accept certificates in place of a college degree is a bit disingenuous. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel like unless you're a prodigy with some amazing side projects, companies won't bat an eye if you don't have some college degree.

2507,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player.

2583,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

3114,"I am nearly finished with this course and have enjoyed it so far. It is VERY entry-level but does a good job covering most of the basics.

3115,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",StatQuest with Josh Starmer,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel like unless you're a prodigy with some amazing side projects, companies won't bat an eye if you don't have some college degree.

3207,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. Good luck!",StatQuest with Josh Starmer,0.18265415140415142,0.5058989621489621,Neutral

3283,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

3500,"Correction:1:47: Points 5 and 6 are not in the correct locationNOTE 1: The StatQuest PCA Study Guide is available! https://app.gumroad.com/statquestNOTE 2: A lot of people ask about how, in 3-D, the 3rd PC can be perpendicular to both PC1 and PC2. Regardless of the number of dimensions, all principal components are perpendicular to each other. If that sounds insane, consider a 2-d graph, the x and y axes are perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 3-d graph, the x, y and z axes are all perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 4-d graph..... etc.NOTE 3: A lot of people ask about the covariance matrix. There are two ways to do PCA: 1) The old way, which applies eigen-decomposition to the covariance matrix and 2) The new way, which applies singular value decomposition to the raw data. This video describes the new way, which is preferred because, from a computational stand point, it is more stable.NOTE 4: A lot of people ask how fitting this line is different from Linear Regression. In Linear Regression we are trying to maintain a relationship between a value on the x-axis, and the value it would predict on the y-axis. In other words, the x-axis is used to predict values on the y-axis. This is why we use the vertical distance to measure error - because that tells us how far off our prediction is for the true value. In PCA, no such relationship exists, so we minimize the perpendicular distances between the data and the line.Support StatQuest by buying The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning!!!PDF - https://statquest.gumroad.com/l/wvtmcPaperback - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZCKR4H6Kindle eBook - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZG79HXC",StatQuest with Josh Starmer,0.03482106129164952,0.4835664335664336,Neutral

I've been in digital marketing for the last 2 years and use web and search Analytics tools quite often. I am quite decent at data studio and spreadsheets as well. I also learnt bit of python, R and Tableau some time ago through online courses and did a few small projects but I don't feel confident at them, mainly because of a lack of practice. Btw my company doesn't use SQL and it's completely alien to me. I want to use my experience in marketing to grow as a data professional. I had been eagerly waiting for this course since google announced it last year. But now I feel it won't be very helpful to me. Do you think I should take this course to further my career?

3915,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",Tina Huang,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week. As for as time, they suggest 6 months, I did it in 10 weeks as I was taking my A+ material.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel like unless you're a prodigy with some amazing side projects, companies won't bat an eye if you don't have some college degree.

4007,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player.

4083,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

4300,"Correction:1:47: Points 5 and 6 are not in the correct locationNOTE 1: The StatQuest PCA Study Guide is available! https://app.gumroad.com/statquestNOTE 2: A lot of people ask about how, in 3-D, the 3rd PC can be perpendicular to both PC1 and PC2. Regardless of the number of dimensions, all principal components are perpendicular to each other. If that sounds insane, consider a 2-d graph, the x and y axes are perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 3-d graph, the x, y and z axes are all perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 4-d graph..... etc.NOTE 3: A lot of people ask about the covariance matrix. There are two ways to do PCA: 1) The old way, which applies eigen-decomposition to the covariance matrix and 2) The new way, which applies singular value decomposition to the raw data. This video describes the new way, which is preferred because, from a computational stand point, it is more stable.NOTE 4: A lot of people ask how fitting this line is different from Linear Regression. In Linear Regression we are trying to maintain a relationship between a value on the x-axis, and the value it would predict on the y-axis. In other words, the x-axis is used to predict values on the y-axis. This is why we use the vertical distance to measure error - because that tells us how far off our prediction is for the true value. In PCA, no such relationship exists, so we minimize the perpendicular distances between the data and the line.Support StatQuest by buying The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning!!!PDF - https://statquest.gumroad.com/l/wvtmcPaperback - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZCKR4H6Kindle eBook - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZG79HXC",Tina Huang,0.03482106129164952,0.4835664335664336,Neutral

Also, when is it inappropriate to use PCA due to experimental design? As an example lets say I have two drugs; an antibiotic and an adjuvant.

4405,"I got into programming because of gaming.I taught myself how to read the script languages of different games so understand how to edit the game files to change different aspects of the game. You could look at the lines of code in these script languages and slowly understand what it all meant and how it all interacted. I started with simple stuff like copying functions and then altering a few things, then progressed to combining functions into new ones, and eventually i'd learned intuitively a solid enough understanding to create my own functions. And the best part was, this wasn't just some in a vacuum for the purpose of learning, I was doing it because I was enjoying seeing the immediate impact on my work in boosting the entertainment value of some of my favorite games. What greater incentive could there be?So that is what got me started down the path and taught me concepts like functions, different types of variables, and so on. I became very proficient in several of these script languages, but the options they had available to them were rather limited compared to actual programming. Some games were designed specifically to be modded and had a lot more options and more complex systems, so as these moddable games got more complex, my understanding of programming concepts evolved as well. I still wasn't a real programmer at this point, I was just a modder.Eventually I stumbled on a game that was moddable, but it wasn't written in a script and instead was written in C++. So I learned a lot of it the same way I learned modding, simply by looking at existing code and figuring out what it did. I learned a great deal from that method, but eventually I had to start looking up how to do specific things. And all these years later, i'm a professional programmer.The biggest thing for me was motivation. I really really wanted to learn not because I had to, not because I wanted money, not for anything else, I learned exclusively because it allowed me to have more fun when playing the games I loved. I would spend hours every single day figuring out how to mod different effects into games. It's kind of funny because I would spend far more time working on something than I did actually playing with it or using it, because I became addicted to the modifications. I would test it, make sure it worked, but then I wasn't satisfied with stopping there to actually play with it usually, I wanted to push further and add more. But anyway, the motivation was the biggest part for my success. I love vidja games.",Tina Huang,0.15490557201083516,0.42901318953950546,Neutral

In those days schools didn't have computers so we wrote our code, tested it manually by doing ""dry runs"" and then transferred it to punch cards using a black pen to mark where the punch holes would be on blank cards. These got sent away to county hall to be run on their mainframe. A week later you got your printout back with your output which was never anything complicated.

As a self-taught software engineer who has been doing this for ten years and now handles hiring at an eCommerce agency as the Director of Engineering, I cannot agree more with you on this video. This video is full of fantastic advice. That part about being immediately suspicious if code runs without an error the first time never, ever goes away. When I write anything if it runs without an error I immediately attach a debugger and walkthrough because I just assume I made a mistake ... this has saved me many times. Some tidbits I would add:1. Learn a version control system like Git2. Always, and I mean always, back up anything you are about to make changes to before you do.3. Accept someone else will always know more, become a sponge4. Learn to take critical feedback. It is not personal. When I review someone's code my feedback is always meant to make them a better engineer.Number 4 to me is critical. When I started out I came from a career as a chef, so I was used to getting very critical feedback. When I got my first reviews of my code in a professional setting the other more senior engineers were stunned when my response was, ""Thank you, I will get these changes implemented.""

4481,"I have to say I fully agree with the sentiment of always try to go beyond the scope of the base project. I first attempted to learn programming through University in 2009, for reasons I had to take a break but eventually got back into it and have been working as a Game Engineer for the last 3.5 years.To the point though, in my Intro to programming class in 09, we were using Java as the language, and the instructor basically had a list of mini projects to try to get through by the end of the semester. The final one being a basic blackjack game...Me being a fan of blackjack I did exactly what you said, instead of doing a base print to console I was looking up and using a lot of the Java GUI functionality to play the game through popup windows that could take user input etc. Nearly had it fully working by the end of the semester.I eventually revisited the blackjack game for another class and built a version of it in Unity.",Tina Huang,-0.18333333333333332,0.44791666666666674,Neutral

4485,"In the beginning it may seem difficult, patience is a great tool when learning to code. Think of coding as a very pedantic logical conversation you are having with the computer. It needs very specific instructions. Take it slow, learn by doing and failing and having a thousand error messages print out the first time you try to compile. Comment your code, every bit of code in the beginning. When you leave your code for a while and come back to it you will understand what you were trying to do. Once you learn something in one language it becomes a lot easier to transfer to a new language if you prefer. Learn things like File I/O and about threads, when you are finished with the basics, it can add a lot of flavour to your projects like adding sound effects to a simple game.

I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",sentdex,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

4907,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player.

I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

I am graduating from community college with my associate’s for CIS concentration this semester. I wasn’t too sure if Data analytics was what I wanted because I had no experience. Your story actually motivated me to give it a shot. I am planning to take the google certificate for data analytics to actually start learning real skills. I wonder if a 4 year degree is required before you land your first job as an analyst. And Jalapeños!,sentdex,0.2089285714285714,0.4103174603174603,Positive

After a few months, the organization was working on reorganizing the structure. And they assigned me a position of data collection. My work is basically on excel and the organization now works on establishing a new database.

5200,"Correction:1:47: Points 5 and 6 are not in the correct locationNOTE 1: The StatQuest PCA Study Guide is available! https://app.gumroad.com/statquestNOTE 2: A lot of people ask about how, in 3-D, the 3rd PC can be perpendicular to both PC1 and PC2. Regardless of the number of dimensions, all principal components are perpendicular to each other. If that sounds insane, consider a 2-d graph, the x and y axes are perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 3-d graph, the x, y and z axes are all perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 4-d graph..... etc.NOTE 3: A lot of people ask about the covariance matrix. There are two ways to do PCA: 1) The old way, which applies eigen-decomposition to the covariance matrix and 2) The new way, which applies singular value decomposition to the raw data. This video describes the new way, which is preferred because, from a computational stand point, it is more stable.NOTE 4: A lot of people ask how fitting this line is different from Linear Regression. In Linear Regression we are trying to maintain a relationship between a value on the x-axis, and the value it would predict on the y-axis. In other words, the x-axis is used to predict values on the y-axis. This is why we use the vertical distance to measure error - because that tells us how far off our prediction is for the true value. In PCA, no such relationship exists, so we minimize the perpendicular distances between the data and the line.Support StatQuest by buying The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning!!!PDF - https://statquest.gumroad.com/l/wvtmcPaperback - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZCKR4H6Kindle eBook - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZG79HXC",sentdex,0.03482106129164952,0.4835664335664336,Neutral

5305,"I got into programming because of gaming.I taught myself how to read the script languages of different games so understand how to edit the game files to change different aspects of the game. You could look at the lines of code in these script languages and slowly understand what it all meant and how it all interacted. I started with simple stuff like copying functions and then altering a few things, then progressed to combining functions into new ones, and eventually i'd learned intuitively a solid enough understanding to create my own functions. And the best part was, this wasn't just some in a vacuum for the purpose of learning, I was doing it because I was enjoying seeing the immediate impact on my work in boosting the entertainment value of some of my favorite games. What greater incentive could there be?So that is what got me started down the path and taught me concepts like functions, different types of variables, and so on. I became very proficient in several of these script languages, but the options they had available to them were rather limited compared to actual programming. Some games were designed specifically to be modded and had a lot more options and more complex systems, so as these moddable games got more complex, my understanding of programming concepts evolved as well. I still wasn't a real programmer at this point, I was just a modder.Eventually I stumbled on a game that was moddable, but it wasn't written in a script and instead was written in C++. So I learned a lot of it the same way I learned modding, simply by looking at existing code and figuring out what it did. I learned a great deal from that method, but eventually I had to start looking up how to do specific things. And all these years later, i'm a professional programmer.The biggest thing for me was motivation. I really really wanted to learn not because I had to, not because I wanted money, not for anything else, I learned exclusively because it allowed me to have more fun when playing the games I loved. I would spend hours every single day figuring out how to mod different effects into games. It's kind of funny because I would spend far more time working on something than I did actually playing with it or using it, because I became addicted to the modifications. I would test it, make sure it worked, but then I wasn't satisfied with stopping there to actually play with it usually, I wanted to push further and add more.

As a self-taught software engineer who has been doing this for ten years and now handles hiring at an eCommerce agency as the Director of Engineering, I cannot agree more with you on this video. This video is full of fantastic advice. That part about being immediately suspicious if code runs without an error the first time never, ever goes away. When I write anything if it runs without an error I immediately attach a debugger and walkthrough because I just assume I made a mistake ... this has saved me many times. Some tidbits I would add:1. Learn a version control system like Git2. Always, and I mean always, back up anything you are about to make changes to before you do.3. Accept someone else will always know more, become a sponge4. Learn to take critical feedback. It is not personal. When I review someone's code my feedback is always meant to make them a better engineer.Number 4 to me is critical. When I started out I came from a career as a chef, so I was used to getting very critical feedback. When I got my first reviews of my code in a professional setting the other more senior engineers were stunned when my response was, ""Thank you, I will get these changes implemented.""

It needs very specific instructions. Take it slow, learn by doing and failing and having a thousand error messages print out the first time you try to compile. Comment your code, every bit of code in the beginning. When you leave your code for a while and come back to it you will understand what you were trying to do. Once you learn something in one language it becomes a lot easier to transfer to a new language if you prefer. Learn things like File I/O and about threads, when you are finished with the basics, it can add a lot of flavour to your projects like adding sound effects to a simple game.

Now, I have a solid understanding on Python (not an expert, but I understand most of the code that's written and  familiar with Object Oriented Programming. Also, I am still learning python) and I have a better conceptual understanding of linear algebra and matrix multiplications. I started learning machine learning recently. Believe me, I was just going through this video skipping most parts, I can actually understand what this lecturer is teaching.

I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",codebasics,0.10529707792207792,0.5722819264069263,Neutral

5907,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player.

5983,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

6200,"Correction:1:47: Points 5 and 6 are not in the correct locationNOTE 1: The StatQuest PCA Study Guide is available! https://app.gumroad.com/statquestNOTE 2: A lot of people ask about how, in 3-D, the 3rd PC can be perpendicular to both PC1 and PC2. Regardless of the number of dimensions, all principal components are perpendicular to each other. If that sounds insane, consider a 2-d graph, the x and y axes are perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 3-d graph, the x, y and z axes are all perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 4-d graph..... etc.NOTE 3: A lot of people ask about the covariance matrix. There are two ways to do PCA: 1) The old way, which applies eigen-decomposition to the covariance matrix and 2) The new way, which applies singular value decomposition to the raw data. This video describes the new way, which is preferred because, from a computational stand point, it is more stable.NOTE 4: A lot of people ask how fitting this line is different from Linear Regression. In Linear Regression we are trying to maintain a relationship between a value on the x-axis, and the value it would predict on the y-axis. In other words, the x-axis is used to predict values on the y-axis. This is why we use the vertical distance to measure error - because that tells us how far off our prediction is for the true value. In PCA, no such relationship exists, so we minimize the perpendicular distances between the data and the line.Support StatQuest by buying The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning!!!PDF - https://statquest.gumroad.com/l/wvtmcPaperback - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZCKR4H6Kindle eBook - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZG79HXC",codebasics,0.03482106129164952,0.4835664335664336,Neutral

6305,"I got into programming because of gaming.I taught myself how to read the script languages of different games so understand how to edit the game files to change different aspects of the game. You could look at the lines of code in these script languages and slowly understand what it all meant and how it all interacted. I started with simple stuff like copying functions and then altering a few things, then progressed to combining functions into new ones, and eventually i'd learned intuitively a solid enough understanding to create my own functions. And the best part was, this wasn't just some in a vacuum for the purpose of learning, I was doing it because I was enjoying seeing the immediate impact on my work in boosting the entertainment value of some of my favorite games. What greater incentive could there be?So that is what got me started down the path and taught me concepts like functions, different types of variables, and so on. I became very proficient in several of these script languages, but the options they had available to them were rather limited compared to actual programming. Some games were designed specifically to be modded and had a lot more options and more complex systems, so as these moddable games got more complex, my understanding of programming concepts evolved as well. I still wasn't a real programmer at this point, I was just a modder.Eventually I stumbled on a game that was moddable, but it wasn't written in a script and instead was written in C++. So I learned a lot of it the same way I learned modding, simply by looking at existing code and figuring out what it did. I learned a great deal from that method, but eventually I had to start looking up how to do specific things. And all these years later, i'm a professional programmer.The biggest thing for me was motivation. I really really wanted to learn not because I had to, not because I wanted money, not for anything else, I learned exclusively because it allowed me to have more fun when playing the games I loved. I would spend hours every single day figuring out how to mod different effects into games. It's kind of funny because I would spend far more time working on something than I did actually playing with it or using it, because I became addicted to the modifications. I would test it, make sure it worked, but then I wasn't satisfied with stopping there to actually play with it usually, I wanted to push further and add more.

This video is full of fantastic advice. That part about being immediately suspicious if code runs without an error the first time never, ever goes away. When I write anything if it runs without an error I immediately attach a debugger and walkthrough because I just assume I made a mistake ... this has saved me many times. Some tidbits I would add:1. Learn a version control system like Git2. Always, and I mean always, back up anything you are about to make changes to before you do.3. Accept someone else will always know more, become a sponge4. Learn to take critical feedback. It is not personal. When I review someone's code my feedback is always meant to make them a better engineer.Number 4 to me is critical. When I started out I came from a career as a chef, so I was used to getting very critical feedback.

It needs very specific instructions. Take it slow, learn by doing and failing and having a thousand error messages print out the first time you try to compile. Comment your code, every bit of code in the beginning. When you leave your code for a while and come back to it you will understand what you were trying to do. Once you learn something in one language it becomes a lot easier to transfer to a new language if you prefer. Learn things like File I/O and about threads, when you are finished with the basics, it can add a lot of flavour to your projects like adding sound effects to a simple game.

A better py solution is to bit shift; i.e. use:isMined = bitString >> len(bitString) - hash_padding This returns 0 if the hash has the correct number of zeros, and 1 otherwise, and makes the difficulty increase easier to work with. It's also truer to form; comparing byte strings using a string function is a little clunky and an indirect way of using the sha256 algorithm.",codebasics,0.10416666666666667,0.4523809523809524,Neutral
